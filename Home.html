        <h2>Welcome to our Health & Well-being website</h2>
        <p>Health and well-being encompass a holistic approach to achieving physical, mental, and emotional wellness, thereby contributing to an individual's overall quality of life. It involves not only the absence of illness or disease but also the presence of positive factors such as vitality, resilience, and fulfillment.</p>
        <p>Here you can find valuable information about leading a healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>At its core, health refers to the state of being free from physical and mental ailments, allowing individuals to function optimally and pursue their goals effectively. It encompasses various dimensions, including physical health, mental health, emotional well-being, social connections, and spiritual fulfillment. Achieving optimal health involves maintaining a balance across these dimensions, ensuring a harmonious integration of mind, body, and spirit.</p>
        
        <p><a href="#content1" class="button">What is Health & Well-being?</a></p><P>Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.
        </P><p>Health and wellbeing issues will change with time, not only because of pandemics or the economic environment but also as the societal concept of health and wellbeing changes. The last few years has seen post-traumatic stress disorder, financial stress and the wellbeing impact of menopause become more relevant and visible in the workplace. Our evaluation of health and wellbeing needs to bear this ever-changing landscape in mind.</p>
